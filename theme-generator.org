*** Extracting Theme Colors in Emacs
To extract all the colors of your current Emacs theme and format them as shown in your example, you can use Emacs Lisp to retrieve the theme's color definitions and generate the desired output.

Below is an Emacs Lisp script that extracts the colors and formats them accordingly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun extract-theme-colors ()
    "Extract colors from the current Emacs theme and format them as fg/bg ANSI color variables."
    (interactive)

*** Extracting All Faces and Their Colors in Emacs
To extract all the faces (not limited to specific examples) from the current Emacs theme and format them into the desired style, you can use the following Emacs Lisp script. This script iterates over all defined faces, retrieves their foreground and background colors, and formats them accordingly.

+ The face names are converted to PascalCase using the ~kebab-to-pascal-case~ function.

You can copy the output and use it as needed.

Using docstring didn't help. All of the faces I want are defined in faces.el

*** Limiting to Faces Defined in `faces.el`
To ensure that only Emacs built-in faces defined in `faces.el` are included, we can filter the faces by checking if their definitions originate from the `faces` feature. This approach ensures that we only include faces that are part of Emacs's core.

Below is the updated script:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun kebab-to-pascal-case (str)
    "Convert a kebab-case string STR to PascalCase."
    (let ((case-fold-search nil))
      (mapconcat #'capitalize (split-string str "-") "")))

  (defun is-face-from-faces-feature (face)
  	"Check if FACE is defined in the `faces` feature."
  	(let ((location (symbol-file face)))
  		(and location (or
  						  (string-match-p "faces" location)
  						  (string-match-p "tab-bar" location)
  						  (string-match-p "orderless" location)
  						  (string-match-p "ansi-color" location)
  						  (string-match-p "font-lock" location)))))

  (defun extract-faces-el-theme-colors-pascal-case ()
    "Extract face colors from `faces.el` and format them with PascalCase names."
    (interactive)
    (let ((output ""))
      (mapatoms
       (lambda (face)
         (when (and (facep face) (is-face-from-faces-feature face))
           (let ((fg (or (face-foreground face nil t) "#000000"))
                 (bg (or (face-background face nil t) "#000000"))
                 (pascal-case-name (kebab-to-pascal-case (symbol-name face))))
             (setq output (concat output
                                  (format "fg%s = \"%s\";\n" pascal-case-name fg)
                                  (format "bg%s = \"%s\";\n" pascal-case-name bg)))))))
      (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Faces.el Theme Colors*")
        (erase-buffer)
        (insert output)
        (pop-to-buffer (current-buffer)))))

  (extract-faces-el-theme-colors-pascal-case)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<buffer *Faces.el Theme Colors*>

*** Steps to Use the Script
1. Copy the above Emacs Lisp code into your Emacs configuration file (e.g., ~.emacs~ or ~.emacs.d/init.el~).
2. Evaluate the function using ~M-x eval-buffer~ or restart Emacs.
3. Run the function by typing ~M-x extract-faces-el-theme-colors-pascal-case~.
4. The output will appear in a buffer named ~*Faces.el Theme Colors*~.

*** Example Output
Here is an example of what the output might look like, limited to faces defined in `faces.el`:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
fgDefault = "#ffffff";
bgDefault = "#000000";
fgBorder = "#cccccc";
bgBorder = "#000000";
fgModeLine = "#ffffff";
bgModeLine = "#444444";
fgRegion = "#ffffff";
bgRegion = "#005f87";
#+END_QUOTE

*** Notes
+ The function ~is-face-from-faces-feature~ checks if a face is defined in `faces.el` by examining its source file using ~symbol-file~.
+ This ensures that only Emacs built-in faces from `faces.el` are included in the output.
+ Undefined colors default to ~#000000~.
+ The face names are converted to PascalCase using the ~kebab-to-pascal-case~ function.

You can copy the output and use it as needed.


* *[17:34:51]* You                 :you:
I think is-faces-from-faces-feature is always returning nil. Can you give me test code to check it?

*** Testing the `is-face-from-faces-feature` Function
To test whether the function ~is-face-from-faces-feature~ is working correctly, we can write a small test script. This script will check a few known Emacs built-in faces (e.g., ~default~, ~border~, ~mode-line~) and print their results.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun test-is-face-from-faces-feature ()
  "Test the `is-face-from-faces-feature` function on a few known faces."
  (interactive)
  (let ((faces '(default border mode-line region minibuffer-prompt))
        (results ""))
    (dolist (face faces)
      (let ((location (symbol-file face 'face))
            (is-from-faces (is-face-from-faces-feature face)))
        (setq results (concat results
                              (format "Face: %s\n" face)
                              (format "  Source File: %s\n" (or location "nil"))
                              (format "  Is from faces.el: %s\n\n" (if is-from-faces "YES" "NO"))))))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Test Faces Feature*")
      (erase-buffer)
      (insert results)
      (pop-to-buffer (current-buffer)))))
#+END_SRC

*** Steps to Test
1. Copy the above code into your Emacs configuration file or evaluate it in a scratch buffer.
2. Run the function by typing ~M-x test-is-face-from-faces-feature~.
3. A buffer named ~*Test Faces Feature*~ will open with the results.

*** Example Output
Here is an example of what the output might look like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Face: default
  Source File: faces.el
  Is from faces.el: YES

Face: border
  Source File: faces.el
  Is from faces.el: YES

Face: mode-line
  Source File: faces.el
  Is from faces.el: YES

Face: region
  Source File: faces.el
  Is from faces.el: YES

Face: minibuffer-prompt
  Source File: faces.el
  Is from faces.el: YES
#+END_QUOTE

*** Notes
+ The ~symbol-file~ function is used to retrieve the source file where the face is defined.
+ The ~is-face-from-faces-feature~ function is then applied to determine if the face is from ~faces.el~.
+ If the function is always returning ~NO~, it may indicate an issue with how ~symbol-file~ is being used or how the source file is being matched.
