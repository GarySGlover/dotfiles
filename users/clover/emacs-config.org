#+PROPRTY: header-args:emacs-list :results silent
* Initialisation
This section contains basic configurations for emacs to tidy up the interface and
set some defaults for the inbuilt modules that don't fit into other categories.

** Disable package downloads
Remove elpa from the package archives so that no packages will be automtically
downloaded. All packages will be installed using the nix package manager.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-archives nil)
#+end_src

** Cleanup interface
Remove some of the default GUI display components that are typically used with
mouse rather than keyboard.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (set-fringe-mode 10)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+end_src

** Disabled commands
Emacs has disabled some inbuilt functions by default as a safety measure. Replacing
the function that is called prior to running these enables all these commands without
further confirmation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq disabled-command-function nil)
#+end_src

** Use short answers
Allow use of y/n instead of yes/no for interactive command confirmations.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq use-short-answers t)
#+end_src

** Clean directories
Tell emacs not to create lock files as everthing being edited is single user so
should have no conflicts over files. Use of no-littering to reduce other files
being scattered in the filesystem and keep the emacs folder clean.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package no-littering
    :demand t
    :config
    (no-littering-theme-backups))
  (setq create-lockfiles nil)
#+end_src

** Buffer auto revert
Revert the buffer to the on disk file contents when they are changed outside of emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Environment Variable import
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :config
    (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "SSH_AGENT_PID")
    (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"))
#+end_src

* Core Utils
Utilities for emacs that support further parts of the configuration.
** Transient
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package transient)
#+end_src
** Posframe
Better popup frames
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package posframe)
#+end_src

** Which key
Popup to show available shortcut keys in current mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key

** Alert notification
When emacs reports an exception the default action is to play a bell sound. This
replaces the sound with a double flash on the modeline background.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun double-flash-modeline ()
    (let ((flash-sec (/ 1.0 20)))
      (invert-face 'mode-line)
      (run-with-timer flash-sec nil #'invert-face 'mode-line)
      (run-with-timer (* 2 flash-sec) nil #'invert-face 'mode-line)
      (run-with-timer (* 3 flash-sec) nil #'invert-face 'mode-line)))
  (setq visible-bell nil
	ring-bell-function 'double-flash-modeline)
#+end_src

** Theme
Setup the main theme and fonts used within this emacs configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil
                      :font "FiraCode Nerd Font"
                      :height 120)
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "FiraCode Nerd Font"))

  (load-theme 'doom-dracula t)
#+end_src

** Transparency
Set default transparency of frames and creation of hydra function for adjusting alpha.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* Project Management
** Version control

Using Magit as the git porcelain. Is configured to use the same window rather than
open a new one for all operations possible. As some operations such as commit open
the diff window as well, those buffers open in a seperate window.
