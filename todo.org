Things that have anoyed me in the config that could do with
* editorconfig
- org src
  - set =buffer-file-name= to extension based on mode
  - rerun ~editorconfig-mode-apply~
* modeline
- display tab/space and indent offset
- display treesitter active
* transient-compile
allow combining tools into single transient
tools
- zig
- terraform
- nix (test & build)
* indent-control and maybe dtrt-indent
also tie this into ident-bars so that if either have set the indent it uses their value rather than whatever it detects.
